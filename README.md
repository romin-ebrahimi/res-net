# res-net
This repo constains a custom implementation of deep residual networks.
The intention of the `residualnet.py` module is to make it easy to create
residual networks and lstm networks for time series forecasting. Although
res-net was originally intended for image recognition, it has applications
to time series. Convolutional filters are analogous to wavelet decompositions
and can be used to extract signals across multiple time scales.
